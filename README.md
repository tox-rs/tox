This library is an implementation of [toxcore][toxcore] in [Rust] - P2P,
distributed, encrypted, easy to use DHT-based network.

## Reference

[The Tox Reference](https://zetok.github.io/tox-spec) should be used for
implementing toxcore in Rust. [Reference source repository].

If existing documentation appears to not be complete, or is not clear enough,
issue / pull request should be filled on the reference repository.

## Contributions

... are welcome :smile:. For details, look at
[CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Dependencies
| **Name** | **Version** |
|----------|-------------|
| libsodium | >=1.0.13 |

## Building
Fairly simple. You'll need [Rust] >= 1.24.0 and [libsodium].

When you'll have deps, build debug version with
```bash
cargo build
```

To run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```
To build docs:
```bash
cargo doc
```
They will be located under `target/doc/`

### With clippy
To build with support for [clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy)
(linting), you need nightly Rust. Usually the latest available version is
required.

To build:
```bash
cargo build --features "clippy"
```

To build & test:
```bash
cargo test --features "clippy"
```


## Goals
 - improved toxcore implementation in Rust
 - Rust API
 - documentation
 - tests
 - more

## Progress
*Not listed items are on TODO*. If you're interested in them arriving sooner,
consider helping :wink:

 - [ ] implementing toxcore
    - [ ] DHT Node
        - [x] ping requests & responses
        - [x] nodes requests & responses
        - [x] CookieRequest
        - [x] CookieResponse

   It will be a subject to changes, and most likely parts that are currently
   public will at later point become hidden. That though depends on the needs.
 - [x] Documentation
    - [x] Simply great. Further improvements in progress.
 - [x] tests
    - [x] tests cover almost all functionality
